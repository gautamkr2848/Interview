/*

Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero. We can perform
following operations on the array.

        Incremental operations:Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
        Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.

        We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest
        possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.

N = 3
arr[] = {16, 16, 16}
Output: 7
Explanation: First apply an incremental
operation to each element. Then apply the
doubling operation four times.
Total number of operations is 3+4 = 7.
