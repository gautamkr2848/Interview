At every index, The amount of rainwater stored is the difference between the current index height and a minimum of left
max height and right max-height.

Here we can use the two-pointer approach to find the minimum among the left-max and right-max of the probable outermost
boundary for any index and iterate likewise.

For example:

Say we have indices i, j and a boundary of (left, right). where i is the left pointer and j is the right pointer.

If the minimum is arr[left], we can say that i is bounded in one side by left and no matter whatever the values are in
between (i, right), the rightmost boundary of i will at  least have height arr[right] which is the probable outermost
boundary for i.

So the water height of water column at index i is arr[left] â€“ arr[i] and we can increment i then.
Similar things happen for j also.
