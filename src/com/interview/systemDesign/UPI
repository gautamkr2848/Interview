Unified Payment Interface

All UPI payments are IMPS

Bank 1  - HDFC, Bank 2 - ICICI

Objective for making UPI
To provide users a standerd interface for payments from one bank to another bank. Earlier or now all the banks have their own way of taking or releasing payment.

UPI id created by google & managed by NPCI (National Payments corporation of India)
NPCI contains upi-id along with bank details as a key value pair

------------------           ---------------------          ------------------          ------------------
|    Client 1    | - PIN ->  |       Bank 1      |  ------> |      Bank 2    | -------> |   Client 2     |
------------------           ---------------------          ------------------          ------------------
                                     ^
                                     |
                                     |
                            ------------------
                            |      NPCI      |
                            ------------------


NPCI also maintains a private key per user for authentication process. This private key was generated at upi creation time.

While doing the payment we have to pass the UPI pin in the app for authentication

When we do a payment request, The request goes to Bank 1. Then Bank 1 send signed request to NPCI and Bank 2.

Client to Bank load will be handled by Bank side because it's a private property

Bank to NPCI load will be handled by NPCI and backed by GOI.

NPCI == DNS for banks

Data Storage

    1 upi id = 1 kb
    700 billion upi id = 700 billion kb
                        = 7 * 10 pow 11 * 10 pow 3 bytes
                        = 7 * 10 pow 14 bytes
                        = 700 Tera byte
                        = 2 peta bytes

    1. The request from user goes to Bank 1.
    2. Bank 1 get bank 2 details from NPCI
    3. Bank 1 sends notification for collect request to client 2
