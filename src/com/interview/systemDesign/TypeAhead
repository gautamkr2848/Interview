Typeahead - also known as autocomplete or autosuggest
It's a tool that many search engines use to provide suggestions

Functional Requirements:
1. Give a list of query suggestions based on user input (as a prefix)
2. List should be in sorted order
3. Response time < 100ms
4. Suggestions should be relevant

Data Structure - Trie

                                D
      DA                        DO                       DI
      DAR                DON    DOL     DOG              DIP
      DART                      DOLL                    DIPLOMA

If the prefix is not available in tree then we will not show any suggestions

class Trie{
    String prefix;
    List<String> top3Suggestions; //for fast access
}
