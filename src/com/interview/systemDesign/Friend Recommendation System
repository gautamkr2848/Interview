Friend recommendation system

Since the friend recommendation system is a must-have thing for FB and is common for
everyone in the social media platform.

Let A and B be Facebook friends, and we are trying to build a recommendation system to
decide whether to suggest C as an option for the People you may know the list.

If A and B have a mutual friend C, there is a high chance that person C might be a friend of A.

If A and C have gone to the same school at the same time period, i.e, a difference in time of
about +1 or -1 years, person C might be a good option to suggest

If A and C have gone/goes to the same workplace at the same location, we have a good chance
of both of them being friends.

If A and C have reacted to the same posts for a long time and thus showing the same interest
can be paired out as a friend. However, this has the least priority as they might not know each other.

If A and C have some mutual private groups, they can be paired as friends and be suggested to
others. For example, some alumni group.

If A has searched and viewed a profile C, then they could be shown as the fact that they have searched
and viewed shows they are interested in and know each other somehow.

If both A and C are tagged in a photo of a post of some friend.

These will be the criteria that will be checked upon before recommending someone to some other.
