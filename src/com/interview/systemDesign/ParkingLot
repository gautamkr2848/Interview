For our purposes right now, weâ€™ll make the following assumptions.
1) The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
2) The parking lot can park bike, cars, and buses.
4) A bike can park in any spot.
5) A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
6) A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It cannot park
    in small spots.
