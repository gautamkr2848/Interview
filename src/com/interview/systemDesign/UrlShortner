    contains
        a to z = 26
        A to Z = 26
        0 to 9 = 10
      ----------------
      total   =  62

      tiny url combinations = Math.pow(62, 7) = 3.5 trillion combinations
                                                If 1000 url/sec then 110 years to exaust

1. Generate random tiny url and check into database
    For same long url's there may be 2 diff. tiny url.

2. MD5
    a. Calculate MD5 of long url which will generate 128 bit long hash
    b. 0 to 3.5 trillion can be represented by 43 bits
    c. Take 43 bits to generate tiny url
    d. For same long url's there can't be 2 diff. tiny url
