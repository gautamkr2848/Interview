The very first thing that we'll do common Java code level optimizations as well as best coding
practices. Then, weâ€™ll look at JVM specific tuning tips and architectural changes to improve
the performance of a Java application.

Identifying Bottlenecks
    Using Load testing tools    =>  Galting

    Find the Slowest Part Of Your Stack
        1. Is a certain SQL statement slowing us down?
        2. Is Redis slower all of a sudden?
        3. Specific HTTP web service down or slow?

Code Level Optimizations
    1. Using StringBuilder for String Concatenation
    2. Avoid Recursion
    3. Use Regular Expressions Carefully
    4. Avoid Creating and Destroying Too Many Threads

JVM Tuning
    1. Heap Size Tuning
    2. Choosing the Right Garbage Collector

JDBC Performance
    1. Connection Pooling
    2. JDBC Batching
    3. Statement Caching
    4. Database Scaling

Architectural Improvements
    1. Caching
    2. Scaling
