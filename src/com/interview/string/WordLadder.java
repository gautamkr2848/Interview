/*
Given a dictionary, and two words ‘start’ and ‘target’ (both of same length). Find length of the smallest chain from
‘start’ to ‘target’ if it exists, such that adjacent words in the chain only differ by one character and each word in
the chain is a valid word i.e., it exists in the dictionary. It may be assumed that the ‘target’ word exists in
dictionary and length of all dictionary words is same.

Example:

    Input: Dictionary = {POON, PLEE, SAME, POIE, PLEA, PLIE, POIN}, start = TOON, target = PLEA
Output: 7
Explanation: TOON – POON – POIN – POIE – PLIE – PLEE – PLEA

Input: Dictionary = {ABCD, EBAD, EBCD, XYZA}, start = ABCV, target = EBAD
Output: 4
Explanation: ABCV – ABCD – EBCD – EBAD



Approach:

Start from the given start word.
Push the word in the queue
Run a loop until the queue is empty
Traverse all words that adjacent (differ by one character) to it and push the word in a queue (for BFS)
Keep doing so until we find the target word or we have traversed all words.

Time Complexity: O(N² * M), where N is the number of words in the dictionary and M is the size of the string
Auxiliary Space: O(M * N)

// change character one by one within char array based on position
// After changing, if word equals to target then return length
