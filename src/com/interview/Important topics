1. Content Delivery Network
    A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a distributed group of servers
    which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
    Benefits of CDN :
        a. Improving website load times
        b. Reducing bandwidth costs
        c. Increasing content availability and redundancy
        d. Improving website security

    In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange
    points between different networks.


2. Distributed Cache    =>  Redis

3. Pub/Sub Model
    The Publish/Subscribe pattern, also known as pub/sub, is an architectural design pattern
    that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This
    pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays
    messages from the publisher to the subscribers. The host (publisher) publishes messages (events)
    to a channel that subscribers can then sign up to.


4. Event Driven Architecture
    Two microservices communicate with each other based on event bus.
    An e-commerce application that uses this approach would work as follows:
        a. The Order Service creates an Order in a pending state and publishes an OrderCreated event.
        b. The Customer Service receives the event and attempts to reserve credit for that Order.
            It then publishes either a Credit Reserved event or a CreditLimitExceeded event.
        c. The Order Service receives the event from the Customer Service and changes the state of
            the order to either approved or cancelled

5. Service Discovery    =>  Eureka


6. Database Sharding
    Example of horizontal scaling
        User table - Storing all the users
        After Sharding -
            Stores  A-I in user1 table
                    J-S in user2 table
                    T-Z in user3 table


7. Load Balancing   =>  Ribbon
    Load balancing refers to the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources,
    with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient.
    Algorithms :
        a. Round Robin
        b. Hash
        c. Consistent Hash
        d. Least Connection

    Benefits:
        a. Reduce Downtime
        b. Increase Performance
        c. Scalability
        d. Flexibility

8. Consistent Hashing

9. Scaling
    Vertical => Buying a bigger system
    Horizontal => Increasing number of instances

12. Apache Kafka

13. Zuul    =>  API Gateway
    Separate Out
        Authentication
        Authorization
        SSL Certification
        Cache
        Static Content
        Also decides where to route a request based on url(ms1 or ms2)

14. Executor Service
     Java provides its own multi-threading framework called the Java Executor Framework.
            1. SingleThreadExecutor
            2. FixedThreadPool(n)   =>  LinkedBlockingQueue
            3. CachedThreadPool     =>  SynchronousQueue
            4. ScheduledExecutor

15. Ideal Thread Pool Size
    CPU Oriented - no. of threads = no. of cores
    I/O Oriented - no. of threads = no. of cores * (1 + waitTime/CPUTime)

17. Resilience4J    =>  Fault Tolerance
    a. Auto Retry
    b. Circuit Breaker
    c. Bulkhead
    d. Timer
    e. Rate Limiter

18. Map Struct  =>  Java Mapper class

19. SOLID
    S   =>  Single Responsibility   =>  Single Responsibility Class
    O   =>  Open Close Principle    =>  Open for extension & close for modification
    L   =>  Liskov Substitution     =>  A = parent & B = child, then we should be able to replace objects of A with objects of B
    I   =>  Interface Segregation   =>  Single Responsibility Interface
    D   =>  Dependency Inversion    =>  High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. They should depend on abstractions

20. CAP Theorem

21. Indexing - https://chartio.com/learn/databases/how-does-indexing-work/

22. Pagination is the task of dividing the potential result into pages and retrieving the
    required pages, one by one on demand.  Using OFFSET and LIMIT is the easy way to write
    pagination into database queries

        client requests parameters with a specific limit (the number of results) and
        offset (the number of records that need to be skipped)

23. CI/CD Pipeline - https://dzone.com/articles/learn-how-to-setup-a-cicd-pipeline-from-scratch

24. What happens if hashCode & equals is not overriden?

    *** You must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals().

    If you don't override hashcode() then the default implementation in Object class will be
    used by collections. This implementation gives different values for different objects, even
    if they are equal according to the equals() method.

    Some collections, like HashSet, HashMap or HashTable use the hash code to store its data and
    to retrieve it. If you don't implement hashcode() and equals() in a consistent manner, then
    they will not function properly.

25. Marker Interface
    It is an empty interface (no field or methods). Examples of marker interface are Serializable,
    Cloneable and Remote interface.

    public interface Serializable {}

26. Concurrency Model
    1. Parallel Workers
    2. Assembly Line
    3. Functional Parallelism   =>  Fork/Join Pool

27. Bean Scope
    1. Singleton - single instance per Spring IoC container
    2. Prototype - single bean definition to have any number of object instances
    3. Request - a bean definition to an HTTP request
    4. Session - a bean definition to an HTTP session
    5. Global - a bean definition to a global HTTP session

28. Time Complexity Depends on
    1. Single vs multi processor
    2. i/o operations
    3. 32 bit vs 64 bit
    4. input => rate of growth of time a/c to input

29. @SpringBootApplication Annotation
    Many Spring Boot developers like their apps to use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra
    configuration on their "application class". A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those
    three features, that is:

        @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
        @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located
        @Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

30. Spring IoC (Inversion of Control)
    1. Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their
       dependencies, manages their entire life cycle.
    2. Spring helps in creating objects, managing objects, configurations, etc. because of IoC (Inversion of Control).
    3. Spring IoC is achieved through Dependency Injection.
    4. IoC is a design principle where the control flow of the program is inverted.
    5. Aspect-Oriented Programing is one way to implement Inversion of Control.

31. Spring Dependency Injection
    1. Spring Dependency injection is a way to inject the dependency of a framework component by the following ways of
       spring: Constructor Injection and Setter Injection
    2. Spring framework helps in the creation of loosely-coupled applications because of Dependency Injection.
    3. Dependency Injection is the method of providing the dependencies and Inversion of Control is the end result of
       Dependency Injection.
    4. Dependency Injection is one of the subtypes of the IOC principle.
    5. In case of any changes in business requirements, no code change is required.

32. Spring Bean Life Cycle
    Bean life cycle is managed by the spring container. When we run the program then, first of all, the spring container
    gets started. After that, the container creates the instance of a bean as per the request, and then dependencies are
    injected. And finally, the bean is destroyed when the spring container is closed. Therefore, if we want to execute
    some code on the bean instantiation and just after closing the spring container, then we can write that code inside
    the custom init() method and the destroy() method.
