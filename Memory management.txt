Memory management

1. Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory 
according to the requirement and optimizes the overall performance of the system.

2. It allows you to check how much memory needs to be allocated to processes and which processor should get memory at what time.

3. In Single Contiguous Allocation, all types of computer's memory except a small portion which is reserved for the OS is available
for one application

4. Partitioned Allocation divides primary memory into various memory partitions. Every partition stores all the information for a
specific task or job. This method consists of allotting a partition to a job when it starts & unallocate when it ends.

5. Paged Memory Management method divides the computer's main memory into fixed-size units known as page frames

6. Segmented memory is the only memory management method that does not provide the user's program with a linear and contiguous address
space.

7. Swapping is a method in which the process should be swapped temporarily from the main memory to the backing store.
 It will be later brought back into the memory for continue execution.

8. Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of
pages.

9. In a computer storage system, as processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into small pieces. In
this way memory space used inefficiently, so the capacity or performance of the system may degrade. Sometimes it happens that memory
blocks cannot be allocated to processes due to their small size and memory blocks remain unused. This problem is known as Fragmentation.

10. Segmentation method works almost similarly to paging. The only difference between the two is that segments are of variable-length, 
whereas, in the paging method, pages are always of fixed size.

11. In static loading, at compilation time, the entire program is loaded into memory and starts its execution.

12. In dynamic loading, references will be provided and the loading will be done at the time of execution.

12.Linking is a method that helps OS to collect and merge various modules of code and data into a single executable file.

13. We all know that Java itself manages the memory and needs no explicit intervention of the programmer. Garbage collector itself
ensures that the unused space gets cleaned and memory can be freed when not needed. However the automatic garbage collection doesnâ€™t
guarantee everything.
