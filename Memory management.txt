Memory management

1. Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory 
according to the requirement and optimizes the overall performance of the system.

2. It allows you to check how much memory needs to be allocated to processes and which processor should get memory at what time.

3. In Single Contiguous Allocation, all types of computer's memory except a small portion which is reserved for the OS is available for one application

4. It divides primary memory into various memory partitions. Every partition stores all the information for a specific task or job. 
This method consists of allotting a partition to a job when it starts & unallocate when it ends.

5. Paged Memory Management method divides the computer's main memory into fixed-size units known as page frames

6. Segmented memory is the only memory management method that does not provide the user's program with a linear and contiguous address space.

7. Swapping is a method in which the process should be swapped temporarily from the main memory to the backing store.
 It will be later brought back into the memory for continue execution.

8. Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.

9. Fragmentation refers to the condition of a disk in which files are divided into pieces scattered around the disk.

10. Segmentation method works almost similarly to paging. The only difference between the two is that segments are of variable-length, 
whereas, in the paging method, pages are always of fixed size.

11. In static loading, at compilation time, the entire program is loaded into memory and starts its execution.

12. In dynamic loading, references will be provided and the loading will be done at the time of execution.

12.Linking is a method that helps OS to collect and merge various modules of code and data into a single executable file.
