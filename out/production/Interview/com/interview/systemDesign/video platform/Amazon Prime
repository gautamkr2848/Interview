Non-functional Requirement
    1. Upload should be fast
    2. No/minimal buffering while viewing video
    3. Eventual Consistency - It's fine if uploading is taking a bit time
    3. Low latency - buffering time should be minimum
    4. High availability - Once the video is uploaded, it should be available

    6. DB sharding we can do based on creator, because people want to view a specific channel

Users - Creator / Viewer

    Creator - Load Balancer - upload video service - MetaData DB
                                                   - Video Splitter - processing queue - video encoder (converts and merges) - object store (S3)

    Viewer - Load Balancer - search service - elastic search api - MetaData DB
                            - view video service - cache - MetaData DB
                                                 - CDN (pulls data from S3 and push it to viewer)
