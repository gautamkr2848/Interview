[1.] Design for failure
- Microservices should be designed to tolerate failure at every level, from infrastructure to individual services.
- Use techniques such as circuit breakers, bulkheads & graceful degradation.

[2.] Keep services small and focused
- A microservice should be designed to do one thing well.

[3.] Use lightweight communication protocols
- Microservices should communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as REST, gRPC or messaging queues.
- This helps to reduce overhead and increase performance.

[4.] Implement service discovery
- Microservices should be able to discover and communicate with each other dynamically.
- Use service registries such as Consul or Eureka or use DNS-based service discovery.

[5.] Automate testing & deployment
- Microservices should be thoroughly tested and automated for deployment, using techniques such as Ci/Cd & automated testing.

[6.] Decentralized data management
- Data should be managed by the services that own it, rather than being stored in a central database.
- This helps to reduce coupling between services and enables independent evolution.

[7.] Monitor services proactively
- To understand how your microservices are performing, it's important to collect & analyze metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates.
- Use monitoring tools such as Prometheus or Grafana, to ensure that they are performing as expected and to identify potential issues before they become critical.

[8.] Implement security at all levels
- Security should be implemented at every level of the microservices architecture, including infrastructure, services, and communication.
- Use techniques such as SSL/TLS, OAuth2, and JWT.

[9.] Centralized logging
- Logs from all services should be aggregated in a centralized location, to enable easy debugging and troubleshooting.

[10.] Standardize development processes
- Development processes should be standardized across all teams, including coding standards, testing frameworks & deployment procedures.
- This helps to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of errors.

[11.] Use containerization
- Use technologies like Docker & Kubernetes to simplify deployment and scaling of microservices.

[12.] Implement resiliency patterns
- In addition to designing for failure, you can implement specific resiliency patterns to improve the reliability & availability of your microservices.
- Use retry policies, caching & load shedding.

[13.] Asynchronous communication
- Use event-driven architecture to decouple microservices and make them more scalable.

[14.] Define clear APIs
- Each microservice should expose a well-defined API that is easy to use and understand.
